	    We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax,
	    which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand.
	    We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages:
	    Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum.
	    To our surprise,
	    we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java)
	    did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords,
	    but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did.

	  <p>
	    The Web was invented so that scientists could use computer
	    networks to collaborate&mdash;that is,
	    exchange documents, discuss them, coordinate work, create and publish collective knowledge.
	    It was, in other words, supposed to be a groupware application.
	    Despite [its] popularity&mdash;or,
	    perhaps, because of [it]&mdash;it has yet to fulfill that original mission.
	    Today's Web is more like a shotgun marriage of electronic publishing and broadcast television
	    than it is like an engineered solution for group collaboration.
